# Overview of Documentation and Resources
## Ontology for Media Creation
**Welcome to the MovieLabs Ontology for Media Creation Documentation and Resources
website.**

### Background

The Ontology for Media Creation (OMC) was developed by MovieLabs and its member
studios to improve communication about workflows between people, organizations,
and software. In order for the software that supports collaboration and
automation in production workflows to interoperate, common data models and
schemas for data exchange are needed. OMC can serve as the underpinnings for
that by providing consistent naming and definitions of terms, as well as ways to
express how various concepts and components relate to one another in production
workflows.

Additional background about the project, its motivation, and its goals can be
found on the <a href="https://movielabs.com/production-technology/ontology" target="_blank" rel="noopener">**MovieLabs website**</a> and in our <a href="https://movielabs.com/our-new-2030-vision-paper-on-software-defined-workflows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">**white paper**</a> on <a href="https://movielabs.com/production-technology/sdw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">**Software-Defined Workflows**.</a>

This website provides three categories of material for the ontology and its
associated vocabulary.

-   Ontology documentation

-   A vocabulary dictionary

-   Other resources, including machine readable forms

### Ontology Documentation

The documentation for the Ontology includes two types of documents:

-   Conceptual documents describing the Ontology, which are navigable online and
    available as <a href="../resources/pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PDFs</a>, covering the following areas:

    **<a href="../docs/omc/overview/need" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Part 1: Overview</a>**

    **<a href="../docs/omc/context/introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Part 2: Context</a>**

    **<a href="../docs/omc/assets/introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Part 3: Assets</a>**

    **<a href="../docs/omc/assets/camera" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Part 3A: Camera Metadata</a>**

    **<a href="../docs/omc/participants/introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Part 4: Participants</a>**

    **<a href="../docs/omc/tasks/introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Part 5: Tasks</a>**

    **<a href="../docs/omc/creativeworks/introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Part 6: Creative Works</a>**

    **<a href="../docs/omc/relationships/introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Part 7: Relationships</a>**

    **<a href="../docs/omc/infrastructure/introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Part 8: Infrastructure</a>**

    **<a href="../docs/omc/utilities/introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Part 9: Utilities</a>**

-   Spreadsheets listing vocabulary terms and definitions for each area, and in
    the case of Camera Metadata defining some mappings to other systems.

These are available for download within each of the online ontology
documentation sections, as well as in the Resources section, here.

### Vocabulary Dictionary

A searchable dictionary containing all of the terms defined in the ontology
documents listed above is available in the <a href="../vmc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vocabulary section</a>. Also, a master vocabulary spreadsheet with
a tab for each area is available for download in the <a href="../resources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Resources</a> section, here.

###  Other Resources

Other resources are available here. In addition to ZIP downloads of the items
mentioned above, they include:

-   RDF and TTL downloads of the Ontology.

-   A SKOS download of the vocabulary.

-   A navigable form of the RDF, including a graphical depiction, for online use
    and download.

## Using the Documentation

### Navigation

For optimal experience, we recommend using a larger landscape screen for viewing
the online documentation.

-   The **navigation menu** on the left lets you select between major topics

-   Once in a topic, the **Page Contents** menu on the right allows you to jump to
    subsections of the current page.

-   Download links for the current topic are displayed just above the Page
    Contents, when available.

### Notational Conventions

In documents generally:

- The definition of a term included in the Dictionary is in **bold**, followed by
  the definition, surrounded by a blue box e.g., 
  > **Creative Work:** A uniquely identified production.

- When a defined term is used in the text of a document, it is capitalized,
  for example in “The Production Scene is usually derived from a numbered
  scene in the Script,” Production Scene and Script are defined in the
  Ontology. (Note, a word that is part of a defined term may sometimes be
  capitalized by itself as a shorthand, e.g., “Scene” may be used to indicate
  “Narrative or Production Scene.”)

- References to other Ontology Documents are in **bold**, e.g., **"Assets"** or **"Camera Metadata"**

For Sample Attributes In the Concept Documents:

- If a data field or attribute is formally defined in this ontology or a
  connected ontology, it is italicized, e.g., _Setup_ as an attribute refers
  to a defined concept.

- Attribute […] indicates an attribute that can appear more than once, e.g.,
  Unstructured Data […]

- →Thing means that an attribute is expressed as a relationship to a Thing,
  e.g., →*Script*

- A combination of the two indicates that the concept can have relationships
  to a set of things, e.g., →Components […]

### Globalization Considerations

Practices in the production process vary from territory to territory and often
within a territory for different types of production, e.g., features vs.
episodic content. The examples and conventions in these documents are currently
biased towards the US film industry but will be expanded in future versions.

The terms themselves are given in English. The Dictionary will ultimately provide them in other languages. It will also have synonyms for terms or concepts that are referred to by different names (e.g., a Creative Work can be called a Production or a Title) or terms that are used for different concepts (e.g., the different meaning of Series in the US and UK broadcast industries or the multiple definitions of Short.)
